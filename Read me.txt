Regarding the assignment requirements:
- Everything is working as stated in the assignment handout except for the zoom in and out part which was
discussed with the professor and chose to leave it not fixed.
- Buttons are as descriped in the handout and are working perfectly.

Notes: 
- One Left click makes the model go white. If clicked again, the model would take the color it already had 
before the first left click. Example: if the model was Red, then I clicked on left click and made it white
and clicked on left click again, it would return back to Red.

- The Clear button "C" clears everything on the screen including the model (which you haave to redisplay using "M")
, the axis (which you have to redisplay usingthe button "A") 
and the extra-credit heart which can be displayed with the button "H".

- Extra credit was implemented to be a heart (with the name "Nouran" in it) which can be displayed using the "H" button. 
By pressing the "H" button, you automaticly remove the main model and the axis from the view. 
By pressing the "M" button, you also remove the heart to view the main robot model again.
The "C" button also clears the heart from the screen. 
A viewtext function was used to be able to view the word "Nouran" on the screen.

One last note: everything is working as expected -except the zooming- and should also have the logic correctly.
(example for the correct logic: if you clear display the model, the heart would disappear and viceversa).
